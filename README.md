## Project Architecture

Below is the architecture of the Financial Data Extraction Tool:

```plaintext
Client (Browser)
  |
  |---> Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
        |
        |---> File Upload Module
        |       |---> Accepts user uploads in various formats (PDF, text, image)
        |       |---> Validates file types and sizes before submission
        |
        |---> Results Visualization Module
        |       |---> Displays extracted data in an intuitive table or card layout
        |       |---> Includes a download option for structured results (JSON/CSV)
        |
        |---> User Interaction Components
                |---> Progress Indicators (e.g., upload status, extraction status)
                |---> Error Notifications (e.g., invalid file type, extraction errors)
  |
  |---> Backend (Flask API)
        |
        |---> File Handling Layer
        |       |---> Manages secure upload and temporary storage of files
        |       |---> Handles file conversion for non-text formats (e.g., image-to-text via OCR)
        |
        |---> Data Extraction Pipeline
        |       |
        |       |---> Document Parser
        |       |       |---> Extracts raw text using PyPDF2, PDFplumber, or OCR
        |       |       |---> Handles multi-page documents and complex layouts
        |       |
        |       |---> OpenAI API Integration
        |       |       |---> Sends parsed text to OpenAI LLM for semantic understanding
        |       |       |---> Extracts context-aware financial fields (e.g., totals, dates, accounts)
        |       |
        |       |---> Post-Processing and Validation
        |               |---> Cleans and standardizes extracted data (e.g., format validation for dates)
        |               |---> Ensures mandatory fields are populated (e.g., invoice number, total amount)
        |               |---> Handles edge cases like missing or ambiguous data
        |
        |---> Results Formatting Layer
        |       |---> Organizes data into structured formats (JSON, CSV)
        |       |---> Prepares the response for client consumption
        |
        |---> Logging and Monitoring
                |---> Tracks API requests and responses for debugging and audit trails
                |---> Logs errors and warnings for proactive issue resolution
  |
  |---> Storage (Temporary and Persistent)
        |
        |---> Uploaded Documents
        |       |---> Temporarily stores user-uploaded files for processing
